        {/* The burden.

            THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WAS A WALL. Set as one four-line block of
            display type, the statement had no shape — every line the same size,
            the same weight, the same colour, so there was nothing to read except
            length. Two rounds of moving it around the page did not help, because
            the arrangement was never the fault.

            SO IT IS NOT A BLOCK ANY MORE, IT IS A CRESCENDO. The sentence
            already has three parts and they are not equal, so they are not set
            equal: the qualifier is small and grey, the turn is mid-sized and
            ink, and the point is large and arrives in blue. The type does what
            the sentence does. That is the whole idea and it needs no picture,
            no rule and no box to carry it — which is also why this section can
            stay on white without reading as empty: the colour event IS the
            argument landing.

            The three beats arrive in order with a held pause between them, and
            the blue on the last one does not simply appear — it sweeps in over
            a second and a half. The section is about whether control lasts over
            time; the line that says so takes time to say it. */}
